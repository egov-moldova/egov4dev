The development of integrated government solutions is guided by a set of principles that ensure consistency, efficiency, interoperability, and security across the entire ecosystem. These principles are mandatory for all actors involved in the design, development, and implementation of government information systems.

## 🧠 Smart architecture

Architectural decisions must be taken at the appropriate level, depending on the scope and impact of the solution. Local architectures (at the level of a single institution) must be aligned with national and sectoral architectures, ensuring interoperability and avoiding duplication of resources.  

The principle requires that any solution is integrated into the national digital ecosystem, supporting data and service exchange through the interoperability platform and common standards.

## ♻️ Reuse of solutions

Architectures must balance consistency with the need for innovation. The reuse of solutions and technologies is encouraged, as long as this ensures efficiency and cost optimization.  

Consistency ensures that systems follow common rules, while innovation allows institutions to improve processes and services with modern technologies.

---

## 📜 Full compliance

Solutions must be developed in full compliance with the applicable legal and regulatory framework. This includes respect for legislation on the protection of personal data, electronic signatures, electronic documents, and auditing of information systems.  

Compliance guarantees that services are legally valid and trusted by citizens, businesses, and institutions.

## 🔒 Privacy by design

Security and privacy must be integrated from the design stage of any system. This includes authentication and authorization mechanisms (for example, through mpass), encryption of communications (tls), role-based access control (rbac), and continuous logging (mlog).  

Trust by design ensures that systems are resilient to cyber threats and that citizens can safely use government services.

---

## 🚀 Cross optimization

Solutions must be optimized for integration into broader workflows. This includes asynchronous flows, orchestration of processes through bpm tools, integration of notifications (mnotify), and delivery of documents (mdelivery).  

Cross-application optimization increases efficiency and reduces duplication of efforts.

---

## 🗂️ Uniform data

Data must be modeled according to a common semantic model and exposed through standardized and reusable apis. Validation mechanisms, such as those provided by MConnect, must ensure the quality and authenticity of exchanged information.  

Uniform data allows interoperability, comparability, and reuse across multiple systems and institutions.

---

## 🔗 Interoperability in mind

Government solutions must be interoperable by default. This means they expose apis (rest or soap), respect open standards, and can be integrated via api gateways or other middleware.  

The principle of interoperability by design prevents the creation of isolated systems and ensures integration at national and cross-border levels.

---

## 🌐 High reliability

Government services must be highly available and reliable. Solutions are hosted on scalable infrastructure (mcloud), monitored continuously, and delivered under clear service-level agreements (sla).  

Availability ensures that services are provided without interruption, while reliability ensures that data and processes remain consistent and trustworthy.
