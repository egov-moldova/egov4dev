This procedure defines the steps, requirements, and responsibilities necessary for connecting the information systems of public and private institutions to the government-shared services managed by the eGovernment Agency (AGE).
The procedure applies to all integration requests for AGE platforms (MPass, MSign, MNotify, MPower, MDelivery, MDocs, etc.) and aims to ensure a process that is:

  - uniform and standardized
  - easy to follow for both public and private institutions,
  - efficient, reducing the time and effort required for integration.

## How integration is initiated

All integration requests must be submitted through the Unified Connection Form, available on the AGE website: https://egov.md/ro. Through this form, beneficiaries can:

  - request the integration of a new information system;
  - extend integration for an already contracted service (e.g., already using MPass and requesting connection to MSign);
  - submit the contractual and technical data required for configuration.

AGE reviews the submitted information and coordinates all subsequent contractual and technical steps.

## Exceptions

Some platforms have separate integration procedures:
  - **MPay** — link to the integration procedure
  - **MConnect** — link to the integration procedure

## General prerequisites

The beneficiary must:

  - own an information system available for integration;
  - for public institutions — have the system registered in the Register of Information Resources and Systems;
  - sign the contract and/or annexes applicable to the requested shared service;
  - for private-sector beneficiaries pay the applicable usage fees;
  - provide a valid system certificate issued by STISC (where required).

---

  - Public institutions benefit from free integration and usage, according to the legal framework.
  - Private institutions pay the applicable usage fees per integrated service (e.g., MPass, MSign, etc.).
