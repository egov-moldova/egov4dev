This procedure defines the steps, requirements, and responsibilities necessary for connecting the information systems of public and private institutions to the government-shared services managed by the eGovernment Agency (MEGA).The procedure applies to all integration requests for MEGA platforms (MPass, MSign, MNotify, MPower, MDelivery, MDocs, etc.) and aims to ensure a process that is:

  - uniform and standardized
  - easy to follow for both public and private institutions,
  - efficient, reducing the time and effort required for integration.

## How integration is initiated

All integration requests must be submitted through the [Unified Connection Form](https://forms.office.com/pages/responsepage.aspx?id=Z4f8jWsRaEKDxfvIWTRtOHwLku9yOJZAs22J7gTUxBNUMFhISEJPMUNGOTIwV09OTkFTUUtLSk9LTS4u&route=shorturl), available on the [MEGA's website](https://egov.md). Through this form, beneficiaries can:

  - request the integration of a new information system;
  - extend integration for an already contracted service (e.g., already using MPass and requesting connection to MSign);
  - submit the contractual and technical data required for configuration.

MEGA reviews the submitted information and coordinates all subsequent contractual and technical steps.

### Exceptions

Some platforms have separate integration procedures:
  - **MPay** — view [integration procedure](../guides/mpay)
  - **MConnect** — view [integration procedure](../guides/mconnect-events)

## General prerequisites

The beneficiary must:

  - own an information system available for integration;
  - for public institutions — have the system registered in the [Register of Information Resources and Systems](https://rsi.gov.md);
  - sign the contract and/or annexes applicable to the requested shared service;
  - for private-sector beneficiaries pay the applicable usage fees;
  - provide a valid system certificate issued by [STISC](https://stisc.gov.md/) (where required).

---

  - Public institutions benefit from free integration and usage, according to the legal framework.
  - Private institutions pay the applicable usage fees per integrated service (e.g., MPass, MSign, etc.).

## What to expect

  - Request reviewed and confirmed
  - Contract and/or annex signed
  - Test environment configured
  - Integration implemented and tested
  - Integration validated by MEGA
  - Service activated in production
  - Final completion notification issued
