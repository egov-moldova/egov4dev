The platform is based on the principles of legality, equal access, authenticity, and shared responsibility of data providers and consumers. Institutions connected to MConnect provide services to other entities through secure communication channels, according to established agreements and legal provisions.  

Today, more than 480 institutions are connected to MConnect, ensuring millions of automated data exchanges every day. This makes MConnect a fundamental component of the national e-Government infrastructure, contributing directly to the digital transformation of public administration.
