## Prerequisites:  

The beneficiary requesting integration must meet the following conditions: 
1. It is a public or private institution that provides public services;
2. Institutions can connect to the MPower system in one of the following ways:  
   2.1 Through API integration – intended for institutions that have their own information system. In this case, for public institutions, the system must be registered in the [Register of Information Resources and Systems (RRSI)](https://rsi.gov.md/procedure).  
   2.2 By creating authorizations in MPower – intended for institutions that do not have their own system. In this case, the configuration of an authorization is performed based on the contract and the request form, without the need for technical integration.
3. The contract and/or annex regarding the use of the MPower service is signed;
4. A person responsible for the integration process is designated.

b)    AGE configures the institution's access to the test environment; 
In the case of creating authorizations in MPower: 
a)    AGE ensures the configuration of authorizations in MPower; 
b)    The institution verifies the configurations and validates their correctness. 
After final validation, AGE activates the authorizations in the production environment; 
The institution receives notification of the completion of the integration.
