MPower is a public portal intended for natural persons and legal entities, both public and private, through which powers of representation can be granted, revoked, renounced, and verified.

MPower provides the capability to verify whether the authorized person (representative) is empowered to act on behalf of another natural person or legal entity (represented) whom they represent.

## **Constraints**
The service depends on the digital identity of third-party systems.
