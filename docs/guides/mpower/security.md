# Security

##**Authentication**

All MPower Clients API calls can be made only by authenticated systems. Authentication is performed using a client authentication certificate.

Information on obtaining and registering the certificate can be found in Chapter 7: Integration implementation.

##**Access authorization**

To access the MPower Clients API component, it is necessary to use the system authentication certificate issued by STISC and registered by AGE in MPass.

The client will call the MPower API using its system certificate for authentication. The API will verify whether the certificate has the necessary rights to access the requested endpoint. If the rights are valid, the request will proceed; otherwise, a 403 (Forbidden) response will be returned.
MPass configuration examples:

=== "JSON settings"

    ``` json 
        {
            "AllowedEndpoints": [
            "/api/Authorization/check/Code-True-One",
            "/api/Authorization/check/Code-Details-One",
            "/api/Authorization/check/TypeCode-Valid-One",
            "/api/Authorization/check/Idn-Details-List",
            "/api/Authorization/file",
        ],
        "ViewAllAuthorizations": false
        }
    ```
!!! note "Note"

     **"AllowedEndpoints"** – specifies the list of endpoints that the third-party system has access to.
     <br>**"ViewAllAuthorizations"** – true/false: true – access to all powers of representation (IR) is granted; false – access is limited to the powers of representation belonging exclusively to the service provider.

##**Encryption**
Communication with the MPower REST API component is encrypted using the standard TLS (HTTPS) protocol.
