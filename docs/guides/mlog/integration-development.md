# MLog — Integration development

### Obtaining credentials

MLog accepts client certificates generated by the Certification Authority of the Center of Special Telecommunications (https://pki.cts.md), by requesting a certificate for authentication for systems.

### Client registration and network access

MLog authenticates clients by the client certificate fingerprint. MLog service clients must be registered in MLog before being able to call the API.

MLog API is accessible only to a registered set of IP addresses. For security‑sensitive information systems, this usually means configuring routes and/or a VPN between the client and MLog.

To register a client and get network access, please send a request by e‑mail to the Service Owner, providing your public IP address (or the VPN‑assigned private IP address) and the certificate fingerprint.

### Technical contract

There are no contracts required to send requests to the MLog system. The system is based on REST services and uses JSON as the message format.

### System environments

There are two service environments available: staging and production.

- Staging
  - Register: https://mlog.staging.egov.md:8443/register
  - Query (time range): https://mlog.staging.egov.md:8443/query
  - Query by UID: https://mlog.staging.egov.md:8443/query/{uid}
  - Former MLog 1.0 (legacy): https://mlog.staging.egov.md:8443/MLog.svc

- Production
  - Register: https://mlog.gov.md:8443/register
  - Query (time range): https://mlog.gov.md:8443/query
  - Query by UID: https://mlog.gov.md:8443/query/{uid}
  - Former MLog 1.0 (legacy): https://mlog.gov.md:8443/MLog.svc

Note: It is mandatory to develop integrations and perform tests using the staging environment.
