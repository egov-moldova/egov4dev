## Obtaining Credentials

MLog accepts client certificates generated by Certification Authority of the Center of Special Telecommunications (https://pki.cts.md), by requesting a certificate for authentication for systems.

## Client Registration and Network Access

MLog authenticates the clients by client certificate fingerprint. MLog service clients must be registered in MLog before being able to call the API.

MLog API is accessible only to a registered set of IP addresses and, for security sensitive information systems, this means configuring routes and/or a VPN between the client and MLog.

To register a client and get network access, please write a request by e-mail to the Service owner, providing your public IP address or the VPN assigned private IP address and the certificate fingerprint in your request.

## Obtaining Technical Contract

There are no contracts required to send requests to MLog system. The system is based on REST services and uses JSON as message protocol.

## System Environments

There are 2 services environments available: a staging and a production environment.

| Environment | MLog Service URL |
|-------------|------------------|
| **Staging** | https://mlog.staging.egov.md:8443/register<br>https://mlog.staging.egov.md:8443/query<br>https://mlog.staging.egov.md:8443/query/{uid}<br><br>Former MLog 1.0:<br>https://mlog.staging.egov.md:8443/MLog.svc |
| **Production** | https://mlog.gov.md:8443/register<br>https://mlog.gov.md:8443/query<br>https://mlog.gov.md:8443/query/{uid}<br><br>Former MLog 1.0:<br>https://mlog.gov.md:8443/MLog.svc |

It is mandatory to develop the integrations and perform tests with the staging environment.
