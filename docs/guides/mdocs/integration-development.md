# Integration development

## Publishing documents to identities
Documents can be published by a client for the document owner as well as for other identities.

1. Upload the blob (document contents).
2. Publish the document with reference to the blob.
3. Create a folder (when the document has no reference to a blob).
4. To create the document in the root, do not indicate a folder ID.
5. To create a document in a folder, indicate the folder ID as the parent.
6. The system can publish multiple documents into a folder by indicating the folder ID as the destination.

## Obtaining credentials
MDocs accepts client certificates generated by the Certification Authority of the Center of Special Telecommunications (https://pki.cts.md) by requesting a certificate for authentication for systems.

## Client registration & network access

- Authentication by **client certificate fingerprint**
- Clients must be registered in MDocs before API access
- API restricted to registered IPs or VPN ranges
- Registration requires:
    - Public IP or VPN private IP
