## Publishing documents to identities

Documents can be published by client for document owner as well as for other identities.

1. The user uploads the blob ([click here](#blobs)).
2. The user publishes the document with reference to the blob ([click here](#documents)).
3. The user will create a folder ([click here](#documents))- for the case when the document has no reference to the blob.
4. To create the document in the root, no folder id is indicated.
5. To create a document in a folder, the folder id will be indicated as the parent folder.
6. The system can publish more documents into a folder, indicating the folder id as destination.

## Obtaining credentials

MDocs accepts client certificates generated by Certification Authority of the Center of Special Telecommunications (<https://pki.cts.md>), by requesting a certificate for authentication for systems.

## Client registration and network access

MDocs authenticates the clients by client certificate fingerprint. MDocs service clients must be registered in MDocs before being able to call the API.

MDocs API is accessible only to a registered set of IP addresses and, for security sensitive information systems, this means configuring routes and/or a VPN between the client and MDocs.

To register a client and get network access, please write a request by e-mail to the Service owner, providing your public IP address or the VPN assigned private IP address and the certificate fingerprint in your request.
