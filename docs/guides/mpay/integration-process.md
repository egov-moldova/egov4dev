## Obtaining credentials

MPay uses certificates generated by Information Technology and Cyber Security Service P.I. (here-and-after called STISC), by requesting a certificate for digital signature and authentication (https://semnatura.md/servicii-aditionale). These certificates must be used for both, SSL authentication and SOAP messages signatures.

For test environment, the service provider (developers) shall use the test certificates obtained from Service owner.

## Payable e-service registration

The following details need to be provided to Service owner for registration.

| Information | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| Service Provider URL | MPay must be able to reach the web-service that implements the IServiceProvider interface. Please provide the URL that can be reached by MPay. |
| Service Certificate | As specified above, this certificate must be used to sign SOAP messages by e-Service. To be able to verify the signatures, MPay must have the certificate registered. |
| Service Provider IP | To access the front-end web page of MPay for manual testing scenarios, please provide your public IP (static) of your information system. |

Additionally, if your deployment infrastructure can filter calls by incoming IPs, then please request the External IP address of MPay and configure your filters appropriately.

## Technical contracts

If you develop an implementation of IServiceProvider interface in .NET, please use the MPay.PublicModel project that is part of the .NET Sample. You can simply create a new "WCF Service Application", reference MPay.PublicModel project and implement MPay.PublicModel.IServiceProvider interface.

If you implement the service provider interface is some other technologies, you can find a copy of the WSDL that describes the contract to be implemented (and an offline copy of MPay WSDL) in the same .NET Sample. The WSDL file can be found in the following path:

```
sample\MPay.Sample.Offline\Service References\SampleServiceProvider\ServiceProvider.wsdl
```
