MDelivery is a governmental electronic service designed to provide a unified and integrated delivery mechanism in order to improve the logistic capability of Public Service Providers to deliver, sort and track physical goods (resulted from provided public services) to individuals and legal entities.

To enable the delivery process, MDelivery is integrated with Service Providers (to receive orders to be delivered) and Carriers systems (to order delivery services) and other governmental electronic services facilitating the process (MPass, MPay, MNotify).
